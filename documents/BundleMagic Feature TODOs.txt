Feature TODOs

On Class browser, show current class of control

Optimize Bundle order
	Find opposite end of wires and order bundler by vertical wire position

Bugs

•	helper files are not complete if dialog is closed before all elements are found.
•	If filter causes nothing to be selected, tab does not advance to listbox and thus also not to done. In this case, maybe we should tab to done

When building support files
•	Add fast splash screen when building helper files
•	On first run of function that requires support files, if files don’t exist and scripting is off, present dialog letting user know that this feature is not available unless the support files can be built, which requires scripting to be on, at least for a few minutes (double check that this is true)
o	Turn scripting off, and attempt to use
o	Show FP of support builder when called

Browse Classes on FP
When the control is shown in the Class Control on the front panel, right-clicking on the control does not activate the Browse Classes… shortcut menu (but right-clicking the Class Control border does)
